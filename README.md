# [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) - script
An AutoHotKey script to customize the keyboard

## What it does?
### Caps lock
It gets rid of the Caps lock, you don't need it, we can make a better use of it. IF SOMEDAY YOU WANT TO WRITE LIKE THIS YOU CAN 

* Caps lock = shiftRight + shiftLeft

### [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) style 
OMG, the arrows of my keyboard are so far away, so lets remap

* Left = Capslock + h
* Down = Capslock + j
* Up = Capslock + k
* Right = Capslock + l

### Tiling windows
For those who are fans of the [i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) but never found an equivalent for Windows

You can enter in the resize and position mode 

* Window mode ON = Capslock + w

In the window mode you can
* Window mode OFF = w
* Resize = h | j | k | l
* Change position = Ctrl + h | Ctrl + j | Ctrl + k | Ctrl + l 

### It does other things as well..
